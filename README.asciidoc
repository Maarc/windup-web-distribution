= Windup Web Distribution

== Overview

This builds a ZIP file containing a self contained distribution of Windup Web.

== Build the Project

To build this project, type:

        mvn clean install

This creates a `windup-web-distribution-<VERSION>.zip` file in the `windup-web-distribution/target/` directory.

The windup-web-distribution build requires artifacts built from windup-web and windup-keycloak-tool. The sequence of commands https://github.com/d-s/scripts-windup/blob/9a0184c9af6d7fc3a33611e071cb3f2620cb7683/windup-web-dist-build.sh[here] should work.
